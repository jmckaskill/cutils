/* 
 * The Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator (PRNG)
 *
 * This is an implementation of fast PRNG called MT19937,
 * meaning it has a period of 2^19937-1, which is a Mersenne
 * prime.
 *
 * This PRNG is fast and suitable for non-cryptographic code.
 * For instance, it would be perfect for Monte Carlo simulations,
 * etc.
 *
 * This code has been designed as a drop-in replacement for libc rand and
 * srand().  If you need to mix them, you should encapsulate this code in a
 * namespace.
